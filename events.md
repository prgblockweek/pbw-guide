{% hint style="warning" %}
**All of these events are independent and have their own organisers.** Prague Blockchain Week is just an independent initiative that connects and informs about these events ([Our mission](our-mission-and-team/)).

If you want information about tickets, or to contact the organizers of a specific event - then contact them directly.
