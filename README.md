<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/pbw23-banner.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Prague Blockchain Week 2023** (PBW23) is a _decentralized conference_ and gathering of all people interested in cryptocurrencies and related topics. It consists of many **independent events** across Jun 2 - 11, including conferences, hackathons, workshops, community meetups, as well as various parties and happy hours.&#x20;

These events will focus on a variety of different cryptocurrency ecosystems and topics such as hard money, payments, DeFi, Web3, DAOs, CryptoEconomics, NFTs, DeSci, mining, and many more.

It is a chain agnostic and neutral community-led initiative. Our goal is not to promote one single blockchain, but rather to stimulate discussion between proponents of different solutions. The common theme is financial freedom, decentralization and privacy.
