# ü§ù Media Partnership Program (MPP)

We are open to partnerships with anyone who would like to regularly report on the events that will take place during Prague Blockchain Week. It doesn't matter if you are a classic media house, a cryptocurrency news site, or an independent journalist or podcaster.

Based on the agreement, media partners will have the following benefits:

* membership in a private group exclusively for media partners
* "press tickets" for individual events
* access to the temporary [Press Center](press-center.md) during #PBW23

Want to join the party and spread the word about the world's largest decentralized cryptocurrency festival? [Contact us](../contact-us.md)!
